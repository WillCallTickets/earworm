So we appear to have echoprint-codegen installed and working

Let's experiment with the basic operation of the concept. So, just enough to prove
the most basic concept = can we get a result back in a reasonable amount of
time with a reasonably simple process? The next hurdle is if it is possible to get
a recorded version or at least partial version (last 30 seconds) of the song.  

* collect an audio file from the user
    * eventually figure out how to do this in real-time
    * stream the input...

* turn that file into a usable format (.mp3) for the codegen
    * see echoprint for complete specs on necessary file - did I see 11mhz mono?

* Is it possible to hear the last xxx seconds of the song in question?

* benchmark how quickly we can receive a response
    * what feels too long? 1,3,5,10 seconds
    * does it seem possible that through some optimizations that we can continue to
        refine this to a reasonable amount of time?

* domain eerwyrm eerworm wyrm
* buy the music that affects you/related songs/artists/etc
* social logins
* social Sharing
* trending worms
* people who were affected by this song also were affected by ??? song as well
* stats - most pervasive earworm, top ten list
* faqs for earworm suggestions
    * phenomena
    * links/compendium of resources
